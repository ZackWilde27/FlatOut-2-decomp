My on-going decompilation of FlatOut 2


I can't make any promises about actually completing a big project like this, but since I'm working on it for fun, may as well put it out there.

Keep in mind, it's nowhere near completion

I've also included the ghidra zip, still new to GitHub but pull requests welcome and all that.
