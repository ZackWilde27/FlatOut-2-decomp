My on-going decompilation of FlatOut 2

I can't make any promises about actually completing a big project like this, but since I'm working on it in my spare time, may as well put it out there.

Decomp2.cpp is my recreation so far

FlatOut2.exe.gzf is the current Ghidra zip file, for anyone wanting to help with the project.

the untouched folder has the untouched Ghidra file, as it may be helpful.

Fouc.exe.gzf is the Ghidra zip file for Ultimate Carnage. The new update removed the DRM so it's now both games are on the radar.
