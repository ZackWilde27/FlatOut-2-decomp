My on-going decompilation of FlatOut 2


I can't make any promises about actually completing a big project like this, but since I'm working on it for fun, may as well put it out there.

<br>

FlatOut2.c is the raw C file exported from Ghidra

Decomp2.cpp is my recreation of the raw C

FlatOut2.exe.gzf is the Ghidra zip file, for anyone wanting to help with the project.

<br>

Keep in mind, as of now it's nowhere near completion
